# Shoppinator
- Shoppinator simplifies the search experience and creates a one-stop location for everything.
- Instead of searching each item and tracking on personal notes, Shoppinator creates a platform to help users to just give the link to the image of his choice. eg: a workplace/livingspace and we will take care of processing the image and suggesting users of different items that he would like to buy.
- Users need not track and search items one by one.
- It provides detail on both online purchase as well as nearby stores based on the user's choice.
- If a user wants in store purchase,Shoppinator provides a list of stores based on the user's location.
